Dear, love is a burning fire
Stay, 'cause then the flames grows higher
Babe, don't let him steal your heart, it's easy, easy

Girl, this game can't last forever
Why, we cannot live together
Try, don't let him take your love from me

You're no good, can't you see, Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set you free, oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart, Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise, oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie, she is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it Louie, 'cause I'm a lover

Stay, 'cause this boy wants to gamble
Stay, love's more than he can handle, girl
Oh, come on stay by me forever, ever

Why, does he go on pretending
That, his love is never ending
Babe, don't let him steal your love from me

You're no good, can't you see, Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set you free, oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart, Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise, oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie, she is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it Louie, 'cause I'm a lover

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie, she is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it Louie, 'cause I'm a lover

Brother Louie, Louie, oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
